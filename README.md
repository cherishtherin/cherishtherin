### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cherish currently living in Taiwan. Funfact I can code and speak 3 languages fluently because I spent most of my life studying abroad. I enjoy learning Java and Python, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. And I speak English, Mandarin, and Indonesian. I also love learning about Web3.
